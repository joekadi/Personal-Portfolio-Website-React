                            After graduating with a MSci in Computing Science, I've been wholly focused on building and 
                            leveraging software to optimise business operations. I also share what I learn over on my <a href="https://joekadi.medium.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>. 
                            During university I had the opportunity to research deep learning and UX, develop many software applications for a range of clients, tutor students and mark exams. 
                            Whilst studying I worked in a consultancy firm as a full stack software engineer and co-founded TÃ“CE Limited.
